# Useful-scripts
Linux scripts that I use to automate things. If you find them useful PLEASE USE/MODIFY.
If anything here looks like your code then please drop me a line and if you wish I will remove.
The aim of this repo is to learn about Github and to try to contribute in a small way.
Being a 'hardware guy'(and dyslexic), I found trying to remember the snytax of some commands a pain. so I tend to write scripts to do simple tasks for me.
If you have any suggestions then please pass them along. Lets share!
Thanks
Alan
